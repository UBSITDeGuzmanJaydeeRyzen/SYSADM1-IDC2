SYSADM1 – Physical Infrastructure
Instructions: 
Answer the following questions based on Week 3 Lecture notes.
Identify potential issues in physical infrastructure setups and propose solutions to optimize performance or reduce costs
Issues:
Wasted Space: Inefficient layout can lead to unused areas.
Power and Cooling Problems: Overloaded circuits or poor cooling can cause failures.
Network Slowdowns: Insufficient bandwidth or poor design can limit performance.
Lack of Scalability: Designs that can’t grow with future needs.
High Costs: Overuse or misuse of resources can increase costs.
You are a project manager responsible for implementing a new infrastructure project, such as a smart city initiative or a digital transformation strategy.
What IT systems and technologies are necessary to support the project's objectives?
Smart City: Use IoT sensors, cloud computing, data analytics, 5G, and smart grids.
Digital Transformation: Use cloud services, ERP systems, cybersecurity, big data, and AI tools. 
How can the IT infrastructure be designed to be scalable and flexible?
Modular Design: Use components that can be easily expanded.
Cloud Services: Use cloud computing for flexibility and scaling.
Virtualization: Use virtual systems to better manage resources.
Automation: Use tools to automatically manage resources and scale up as needed.

What are the potential security risks and vulnerabilities, and how can they be addressed?
Data Protection: Use encryption and multi-factor authentication.
Network Safety: Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
Physical Security: Secure data centers and equipment.
Compliance: Follow relevant laws and standards.
How can the IT infrastructure be integrated with existing systems and processes to minimize disruption?
Choose Compatible Tech: Ensure new tech works with current systems.
Phased Rollout: Introduce changes gradually to avoid disruptions.
Train Staff: Teach staff how to use new systems.
Test Thoroughly: Run tests before full deployment to fix problems.

**Course Reflection**

What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet,
exceed, or fall short of these expectations?
- Learning hands-on skills like server setup, network configuration. and troubleshooting system issues.

What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did
these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?
- The course covers essential topics such as operating system installation and configuration, server monitoring, system security, and backup and recovery.

Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective
strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course
material?
- The most effective ways that helped me learn were hands-on practice, taking notes, and working with others. Doing tasks like installing systems, configurations, and fixing problems helped me understand the lessons better. Writing down the key points during class made it easier to review later. Talking and solving problems with classmates gave me new ideas and made hard topics easier to understand. These simple steps, along with asking for help when needed, made learning smoother and easier to follow.

Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that
significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they
effective?

Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course? How
did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from them? 
- Yes, I had some challenges in the course, like understanding hard topics such as managing services in windows, understanding acceptable policy. To overcome them, I practiced often, and watched simple videos to learn more. I also worked with classmates to help each other. From these struggles, I learned that being patient, asking for help, and breaking big tasks into smaller steps can make hard things easier to handle.

Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it
promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or
decision-making?
